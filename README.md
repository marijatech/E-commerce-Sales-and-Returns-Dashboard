## ✅ Key Business Questions Answered 

### 1. Which product categories generate the most revenue?  
→ *Clothing* and *Sports* are the top-performing categories, each generating over **5.3M** in revenue.

### 3. Which region has the highest return rate?  
→ The *West* region shows a significantly higher return rate at **25.75%**.  
📌 *Recommendation*: Conduct deeper analysis in that region to identify underlying issues (e.g. delivery time, product quality, miscommunication). Consider deploying surveys or customer service reviews.

→ *Bank Transfer* customers have the highest return rate (**5.25%**), while *PayPal* customers have the lowest (**4.74%**).  
📌 *Recommendation*: Monitor purchasing behavior based on payment method and consider stricter validation or follow-up communication for higher-risk methods.

### 6. Who are the top 10 customers by spend?  
→ Customers spending **over 12K individually** were identified.  
📌 *Recommendation*: Create a loyalty strategy tailored to these high-value customers (e.g., early access to sales, VIP perks), as they represent strong retention and upsell opportunities.
